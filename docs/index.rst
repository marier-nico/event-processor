Process Events In Style
=======================

This library aims to simplify the common pattern of event processing. It simplifies the process of filtering,
dispatching and pre-processing events as well as injecting dependencies in event processors.

The only requirement is that your events are regular python dictionaries.

Take a look at the following examples to get an overview of the features available! Of course, you can mix and combine
them in any way you like to create more complex scenarios.
